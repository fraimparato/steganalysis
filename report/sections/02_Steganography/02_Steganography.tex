\section{Steganography}

As we already stated, steganography is used to hide a message in a
\emph{cover type}. We can define a cover type as the mean used to communicate,
which can be a text file, an image, an audio recording, but also people, like in
the case of the servants that we have mentioned earlier, etc\dots

In all these cases, the message has been \emph{embedded} into the cover type.
Here we can make a distinction between steganography and watermarking since in
both cases a message is encoded into a communication's mean, but with different
purposes.
