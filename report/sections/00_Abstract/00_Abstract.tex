This paper provides a general view about steganalysis with hints to
steganography. 

Steganography is the art of hide information into a cover type (the mean of
transmission used to hide the message) \cite{steganography-definition}.
Steganalysis is the analysis used to find whether in a cover type there is an
hidden message.

We will cover the state of art of the most important and used methods of
steganalysis for different cover types: images (stego-key search, difference
image histogram method, closest color pair method, JPEG steganalysis), audio
(non compressed and compressed methods, phase coding, Mp3 steganalysis), text
and TCP/IP.

Moreover, we will give describe the general types of analysis that one can
perform: statical, visual, spread spectrum, signature, transform domain,
universal.

At the end we will conclude explaining why steganography and steganalysis are
important, also joining those two subjects with a wider theme like security in
sending information.
